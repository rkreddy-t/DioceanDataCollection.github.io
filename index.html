									Our client Diocese of Bridgeport collects data on the operations of the different
									parishes it oversees which encompasses financial data, parish
									attendances, events and activities at the different parishes and historical
									data.<br>This application was being developed on Appian to sort out our client
									“Diocese of Bridgeport” needs, also having an application that matches
